Site Show

A little rails app to showcase different site ideas to clients.

or to show the progression of a project, possibly pulling the data from Git.

Each commit could render a view of the changed styles and HTML. 

Similar to an image gallery where clicking "Next" will put the user into the next chronological adaptation of a/the site.
